*This is part of an assignment for the [Learning how to learn course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/course/learning)*

Learning, specially science and math topics, usually ranges from the incredible feeling of understanding to the baffling feeling of _I have no idea what I am doing here_. While the first feeling is amazing, what gets burned in our brains is the feeling of powerlessness of not being able to understand a specific math or science topic.

I remember that back in college I had this profound difficulty of understanding what a *C pointer* was. I couldn't wrap my head around the idea of that thing that points to another thing in memory so I could access that memory in my program and tell other parts of the program about it. Still, while I didn't actually understand the concept, I made my way through classes and ended up moving forward.

Coming from high school where I had very little trouble understanding the concepts, this college experience was a bad start. How could I be having so much trouble to understand these topics now if I had always been able to cruise through concepts?

Once we went off for winter break (June/July down here at the southern hemisphere) I decided to use the time off to prepare myself to the new topics we would be learning and the first book was [Deitel's Java How to Program](http://www.amazon.com/Java-How-Program-4th-Edition/dp/0130341517). Every day I would read a bit, do the exercises and, well, enjoy my vacation, of course. One of these days, a bit after I had learned about references in Java, the *C pointers* thing clicked.

It was one of those _AHA!_ moments out of nowhere, were all the pieces of the puzzle fell in place and the concept finally solidified in my mind. I had finally figured out what all those stuff was about and why they were there. It wasn't the last time I felt like that in college, but it was definitely the moment I finally decided that this programming thing was definitely for me.

It would take me a while to understand how that actually happened.

# Focused and diffuse mode thinking

Scientists nowadays believe our brain functions using two different networks, the _highly attentive states_ and the _resting state_ networks. We could call these the focused and the diffuse modes of thinking, respectively.

You enter the focused mode when you focus your brain into an specific problem or activity. When I was reading through Deitel's book, I was exercising the focused mode, intentionally pushing the information in there into my brain by reading and doing the exercises.

The diffuse mode happens when you are not specifically focusing on anything, when you let your mind drift away and leave it to itself. When I was riding the bike, walking, doing chores, taking a bus to watch a movie or just not doing anything at home my mind would be in diffuse mode.

The moment pointers clicked, I was in diffuse mode, my mind was wandering and connecting the ideas I had learned before while focused and it happened to finally connect the dots to make me understand pointers.

When you are in focused mode, you are working with a small set of information, you're reading a book, watching a lecture or listening to a podcast. The information in there is usually focused on a single specific subject, and this is great. You don't want to be watching a lecture that goes from Haskell to ancient aliens and ends up in rocket science, it would be really hard to understand any of it.

But this focus also means that you are really focused on this specific subject and it would be hard to connect it to seemingly unrelated topics but that could yield a new solution a problem you are working on. And this is when the diffuse mode kicks in and shows it's importance.

![I don't always fall, but when I do, I define gravity]({{ site.url }}/images/apple-gravity-small.jpg#img-thumbnail) When your mind is drifting in diffuse mode, it is functioning in a big picture way, it's not focusing directly at the specificities of a problem, but how it might relate to the other chunks of information you already have in your mind. Think about [Newton's apple incident (yes, it might not be true)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton#Apple_incident), Voltaire said:

> Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.

He was _walking in his gardens_ when the thought reached him. Magic, right?

Not quite. Newton had been thinking about this terrestrial gravity thing for a while already and he had a large body of knowledge in physics and the forces in the universe already, which he acquired through focused and diffuse mode thinking before, but maybe he needed this small glimpse of creativity (yes, science and math also require creativity) to connect the many concepts he had in mind.

He needed to have this big picture view of the ideas to connect them, but he first needed to pump these ideas into his mind using the focused mode. The diffuse mode can only connect information that is already available in your brain, it can't magically produce knowledge you never had, you'll never _get_ calculus in some magic moment if you never actually try to understand and study limits, derivatives and integrals, the information is just not there to be connected.

# Take it easy

One of the major mistakes we make when studying is *studying too hard*. You find a hard problem you can't solve right away or figure out a simpler solution but you keep banging your head to the wall trying to figure out the solution, but it never comes. Then, you go to sleep, for a walk or have a shower and the solution hits you.

This is not an accident. You were in focused mode all the time trying to solve the problem but the actual solution was somewhere you weren't connecting in focused mode, you were _thinking inside the box_. The actual solution required you to _think outside the box_ but, unfortunately, you can't consciously do that.

When you find a hard problem you can't solve after a long stretch of using your focused thinking, it might be the sign you need to leave it be for a while so your mind can try and fix it in the background. To do that you need to let the diffuse mode kick in and some of the best ways to do that are:

* Sleep on it - this is the most common and powerful way of doing it. Famous creatives like Thomas Edison and Salvador Dali used to sit holding an object in their hand so it fell and woke them up when they started to drift away, this was just enough time to let the diffuse mode to kick in and connect their ideas;
* Go out for a walk, running, swimming - many writers like Jane Austen and Charles Dickens used to go for a walk to get a creativity boost;
* Have a shower;
* Meditate;
* Listen to music;
* Talk to others;

Anything that takes your mind away from the problem at hand and doesn't send you into focused mode again will do, really. The main takeaway here is that forcing yourself to solve a problem when the connections aren't really there is hardly going to get you somewhere.

Worse, research has shown that we learn much more by spaced repetition (when you study something now and only study or practice again a day or more later) than by trying to repeat the same study or exercises one after the other. Your mind needs to rest so it can make connections and staying on focused mode all the time going over and over the same information won't really help you much at it.

To learn effectively, you need to be able to switch to both modes. You need to push the ideas into your brain by using the focused mode but you also need to let it connect with the other concepts you already have in your mind, specially when solving problems, so you can really build upon what you're learning.
